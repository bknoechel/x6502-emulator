vcpu - Virtual CPU

This is a test project to emulate a x6502 processor. My objective is to learn
more about computers so I will attempt to write my own emulator in C.

There is a debian package xa65 that is a cross-assembler and utility for
65xx/65816 processors. You can run from command line with `xa'
