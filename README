x6502 Emulator

This is a project to emulate a x6502 processor. This was suggested as a project to help learn about low level computer concepts. This was also a chance for me to write something in C. This is strictly a project for my own learning and interest.

There is a debian package xa65 that is a cross-assembler and utility for 65xx/65816 processors. You can run from command line with `xa'. You can use that write and compile some small programs for the 6502 chip, and then my program will execute those instructions.
